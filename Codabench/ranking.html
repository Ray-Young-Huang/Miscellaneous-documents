    <h2 align="center">ISBI 2026 - Ranking and Scoring Criteria of the CSV Challenge</h2>
    <h3>Key requirements for the ranking process:</h3>
    <p class="bodyText">
        The final rankings were determined by a weighted combination of three components: Classification score: 
        40% weight, Segmentation score: 40% weight, and Processing Time score: 20% weight. Considering that the 
        objective of this task is to comprehensively evaluate the risk of carotid plaques through both classification 
        and segmentation, we deemed classification and segmentation to be more critical than processing time, 
        higher weights are assigned to these two aspects compared to processing time. This comprehensive evaluation 
        aligns with the challenge’s objective to assess both segmentation, classification, and computational 
        performance, ensuring a multi-dimensional assessment of participants’ solutions. The overall score is calculated as follows:
    </p>
    \[
    S_{\text{Total}} = 0.4 \times S_{\text{Cls}} + 0.4 \times S_{\text{Seg}} + 0.2 \times S_{\text{Time}}
    \]
    <p class="bodyText">
        Where S_cls represents classification score, S_seg represents segmentation score, and S_time represents 
        processing time score. Figure 1 illustrates the overall score framework of our challenge.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="bodyText">
        <b>1. Classification Score: </b>Class imbalance is an inherent issue in this task. To comprehensively evaluate 
        classification performance, we adopt the mean F1-score across all classes as the final classification score. 
        The calculation formula is as follows:
    </p>
    \[
    S_{\text{Cls}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} F_{1_i}
    \]
    <p class="bodyText">
        Where N denotes the total number of classes.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="bodyText">
        <b>2. Segmentation Score: </b>As shown in Figure 1, in the semi-supervised segmentation task, segmentation 
        score is calculated by both the vessel and plaque of the longitudinal and transverse views, each contributing 
        50% to the overall segmentation score. 
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        For each view, the score is calculated based on two evaluation metrics — Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) 
        and Normalized Surface Dice (NSD) — which are equally weighted (50%). Considering that accurate plaque segmentation 
        is more clinically important than vessel segmentation, we assign a weight of 40% to the vessel and 60% to the plaque. 
        The segmentation score is calculated as follows:
    </p>
    \[
    S_{\text{seg}} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{v \in \{\text{long, trans}\}} 0.4 \times S_{v, \text{vessel}} + 0.6 \times S_{v, \text{plaque}}
    \]
    <p class="bodyText">
        Here, 𝑣 denotes the view type (longitudinal and transverse).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="bodyText">
        <b>3. Processing Time Score: </b>The processing time score is calculated based on the participant's 
        inference time relative to a baseline time. The scoring rules are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
        <li class="bodyText" style="list-style-type: disc;">If a participant's time was \( \leq 2/3 \) of the baseline time, their time usage was set to 
            <strong>\( (2/3 \times \text{baseline time}) \)</strong>.</li>
        <li class="bodyText" style="list-style-type: disc;">If a participant's time was \( \geq 2 \) of the baseline time, their time usage was set to 
            <strong>\( (2 \times \text{baseline time}) \)</strong>.</li>
        <li class="bodyText" style="list-style-type: disc;">Otherwise, it was set to <strong>(total time)</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodyText">
        After min-max normalization and score transformation was applied to yield a [0, 100] score. 
    </p>    
    <p class="bodyText">
        The processing time score is calculated as follows:
    </p>
    \[
    S_{\text{time}} = \frac{(-t_{\text{user}}) - (-T_{\text{max}})}{(-T_{\text{min}}) - (-T_{\text{max}})} \times 100
    \]
    <ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
        <li class="bodyText" style="list-style-type: disc;">\( t_{\text{user}} \) is the participant's (clipped) total time usage.</li>
        <li class="bodyText" style="list-style-type: disc;">\( T_{\text{min}} = 2/3 \times \) baseline time is the fastest acceptable case (upper bound).</li>
        <li class="bodyText" style="list-style-type: disc;">\( T_{\text{max}} = 2 \times \) baseline time is the slowest acceptable case (lower bound).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodyText">
        The baseline runtime will be released together with the dataset. 
    </p>
    <img src="assets/ranking.png" alt="Evaluation Framework" style="width:100%" align="center">
    <p class="bodyText">
        Each case includes B-mode carotid ultrasound images from two views: the longitudinal and transverse. For each case, segmentation results should be 
        provided separately for both views, while a single classification result should be generated based on the combined information from both views.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Awards and Prizes:</h3>
    <p class="bodyText">
        We will provide cash prizes for the top 5 teams. A certificate will be awarded to the top 10 teams. The top 10 performing methods (teams) will be 
        announced publicly and invited to give oral presentations during the ISBI 2026 conference.
